On April 20th and 21st, I am going to Pittsburgh for [Heartifacts](https://codeandsupply.co/heartifacts), a conference run by Code & Supply. As I am going down there, anyway, I want to do a few things - [high point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_elevation), road-trip, minimise my carbon footprint, and see friends in Philadelphia and perhaps Baltimore.

The route looks something like this:

I've already highpointed all of New England, so I'm not that interested in doing them again (although Rhode Island is fun). This trip would high point the remaining states in the direct area: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia. All in all, it should be roughly 35 hours of driving - 5 to Boston, 4 to New Jersey and 6 to Pittsburgh, and then the rest coming back. Getting to Pittsburgh should take around two or three days. Going to Boston would be necessary if I drop off Heather, and going to Philly would be necessary if I pick up Matt or if I can see Jen. That's my general plan.

All in all, it should take roughly 10 days - 3 to Pittsburgh (perhaps 2), 2 in Pittsburgh, and 3-4 back, with some extra days for good luck. I plan to book the car from April 17th.

I also may not return to Canada. It's possible that I could pack up all of my stuff, drive down to my storage unit near Boston, drop it off, do the drive, and then have a friend take the car back up to Canada. Then, I'd drive across the country with my sister or with my stuff, moving to Seattle or Boulder or something. In late May I need to be in Berlin for the Node Summit, but that's about all of the plan I have currently. All of this is liable to change.

Anyone interested in coming?
