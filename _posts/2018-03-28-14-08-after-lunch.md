Tasks done recently:
- Sorted my [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) physical inbox;
- Ate lunch;
- Talked to the CBC about by interview next week for [Silent Book Club](https://www.facebook.com/events/159627981518617/);
- Went to Cafe Névé and showed them [Heather's art](https://burntfen.com/heather), which I put up on the website this morning. My last [art](https://burntfen.com/art) I showed them wasn't something they were interested in hanging; nominally, they said they wanted more colour, but I'm guessing they probably thought it looked like I made it five minutes. They wouldn't technically be wrong, but that wasn't why I did it.
- Went grocery shopping and prepped dinner.
- Watched the second episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender over lunch.

All of this is probably beyond uninteresting. That's how it goes. Up next: describe the language endangerment index in [my thesis](https://github.com/RichardLitt/thesis).
