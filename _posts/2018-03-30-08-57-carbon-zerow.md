Morning again. Today is Friday; nominally a regroup and rethink day. I've got some emails to take care off. That's my first priority, today - figuring out what I've left undone this week, and whether or not I can start it easily today or whether I need to allocate longer sections of time.

Yesterday, I rebuilt [carbonzerow.org](https://carbonzerow.org) for my friends, in Jekyll and hosted on Netlify so that we can stop paying for the Wix site but still have SSL enabled and an easily editable site. That took a few hours. I also talked at length with Kyle about our plan to set up an expedition website (which I talked about a while ago [here](https://richardlitt.github.io/2117.91USD/2018/03/16/18-06-adventure-branding/)).

I also finished the metrics rebuttal for my thesis, spent time wondering if I could convert LaTeX to HTML easily enough to put it here (no, but it is in section [2.2](https://github.com/RichardLitt/thesis) in the PDF), did some work for my UX auditing company, and generally worked on a lot of smaller tasks in between

Right. Emails.
