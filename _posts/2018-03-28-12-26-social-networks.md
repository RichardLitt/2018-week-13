I have too many [social networks](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/social-networks.md). I realised recently that I continually drop notifications when I switch between them. So, I wrote up a list, and now, a few times a week, I go through all of them and check if there are any updates and any missed messages.

Seems like a good system, so far.
