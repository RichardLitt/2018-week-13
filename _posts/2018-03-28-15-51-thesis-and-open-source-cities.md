[Writing up a review](https://github.com/RichardLitt/thesis/blob/master/2-endangered-languages.tex#L159) and summary of the Language Endangerment Index used by endangeredlanguages.com, I had a wonderful experience. I didn't like the fact that the LEI waved over some issues with language assessment raised by the other standards - in particular, by the UNESCO standard, which specifically prohibited counting up all of the measurements of the numbers into a single stat - and assigning a single number to a language as a measure of its endangerment. I found this to be qualitatively interesting as a method for fitting a square into a circle-shaped hole, but not exactly the most scientific approach to complexity, and to not be well backed up with reasons besides that they were building an assessment index.

Then, I found [Grenoble's response](http://sci-hub.hk/https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404515000950), which summarised my feelings much better than I could have, and using the appropriately hedged scientific language (unlike this blog, which is not academic and which should be taken with a grain of salt). It was immensely satisfying to have my doubts validated.

And the writing continues. Ten pages since last week this time.

I also just sat down with my friend Ruy, in the midst of writing this post, to discuss the now upcoming [Open Source Montreal](https://github.com/opensourcecities/montreal) meetup! Probably on April 9th, this will be the first meetup just about open source, language agnostic, in Montreal. I'm excited for it - I had thoughts about running a FLOSS event in each city I visit, through [@opensourcecities](https://github.com/opensourcecities). I wonder how this will go.

Next up: it's 1600. Time for a long break, because the 1600-1800 hour gap is almost never productive for me, no matter how hard I force it.
