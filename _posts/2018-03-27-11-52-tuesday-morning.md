I built [a little script](https://github.com/RichardLitt/utils) for automatically copying over a week's journal over to a new repository. Repos are cheap; and while I could tag everything and use the same blog, I don't really see a need to. And I like the idea of starting fresh every week.

Yesterday I worked mainly on [my thesis](https://github.com/RichardLitt/thesis), something which has continued today. This morning I wrote the section on EGIDS; next up, explaining the Language Endangerment Index (LEI) from Google's endangeredlanguages.com.

I also moved [theuserisdrunk.com](https://theuserisdrunk.com) this morning from GitHub over to Netlify. It now has SSL enabled. Been meaning to do that for a while; only took twenty minutes.

I went hiking last weekend, but came back sooner than I expected. This afternoon I am going to [Oka National Parc](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Oka_National_Park), the last of the [Monteregian Hills](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monteregian_Hills) (of which Mont Royal is also one).
